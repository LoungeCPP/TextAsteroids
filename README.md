# TextAsteroids

Asteroids are falling toward your planet,
and YOU are the captain of the only ship in range!
Unfortunately, your rocket ship only responds to the following text commands:
  - q   : turn left
  - e   : turn right
  - w   : accelerate upwards
  - s   : accelerate downards
  - a   : accelerate left
  - d   : accelerate right
  - pew : fire your weapon
  
Use your rocket ship to defend your home! Or don't. Whatever.
